# Gaelic-Type-Keyboard-Layout
A Gaelic type keyboard layout, with features for Old Irish, created with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) Version 1.4

The layout is based on the Irish keyboard layout which already allows for acute accent combinations with AltGr + a, e, i, o, u = á, é, í, ó, ú (and their respective capital forms).

The Irish keyboard also includes dead keys for the acute and grave accents. The dead key for the acute accent is AltGr + ' which allows for the typing of an acute accent over y = ý, as well as the other vowels, and an isolated acute accent by following the dead key directly with SPACE, i.e. AltGr + ', SPACE = ´. The dead key for the grave accent on the Irish keyboard is simply `, which, like the dead key for the acute accent, works on each of the vowels (with the exception of y) and allows for the typing of an isolated grave accent by follwoing the dead key directly with SPACE.

The new Gaelic type features included in this keyboard layout include an over-dot (a.k.a. ponc séimhithe or punctum delens) for various consonants with AltGr + b, c, d, f, g, m, p, s, t = ḃ, ċ, ḋ, ḟ, ġ, ṁ, ṗ, ṡ, ṫ (and their respective capital forms). Another feature is the Tironian et which can be typed with AltGr + 7 = ⁊.

The new Old Irish features inluded in this keyboard layout include the diaeresis diacritic for the vowels by creating a new dead key with AltGr + ;. Upon pressing the dead key, one can following directly with one of the vowels a, e, i, o, u = ä, ë, ï, ö, ü (and their respective capital forms), or with a SPACE = ¨. The remaining feature is an interpunct which can be typed with AltGr + - = ·.
